/*
 * ============================================================================
 *  DRAFT — process-planning as a /workflows script  (Phase-1 pilot conversion)
 * ============================================================================
 *  STATUS: DRAFT. NOT ADOPTED. Do not place in .claude/workflows/ and do not
 *  wire it into the live process-planning skill yet.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS: the procedure-layer-as-workflows program converts the prose
 *  process skills (which the model is *asked* to follow, ~78.5% step-compliance)
 *  into deterministic Workflow scripts that make the dispatch sequence happen by
 *  construction. process-planning was chosen as the Step-1 pilot: MCP-free core,
 *  softest judgment nodes, .md output checkable without MCP, already-sequential.
 *
 *  ENGINE PROOF (2026-06-09, runs wf_fac88a36-d37 + wf_cb505471-569): a workflow
 *  agent() has the FULL tool surface — Bash, Read, ToolSearch, qmd MCP, n8n MCP.
 *  So Step-1 scope-reads (STATE.md/PROJECT.md) run inside an agent() here.
 *  See finding workflow agents reach mcp via toolsearch.
 *
 *  ADOPTION GATE (NOT cleared): the Action-0.1 calibration spot-check (Wiktor)
 *  must establish the output-quality baseline before this replaces the prose
 *  skill, because the program's success metric is output-USE/quality, not
 *  dispatch-presence (which this script makes tautologically ~100%).
 *
 *  SCOPE DISCIPLINE (corpus Reframe 1 — "govern routing, not execution"): this
 *  script encodes the dispatch SEQUENCE + typed HANDOFFS + GATES only. Each
 *  agent() works freely inside its step; nothing here scripts how an agent
 *  reasons. If you find yourself encoding *how* the plan is written, stop —
 *  that belongs inside implementation-plan, not here.
 *
 *  KNOWN OPEN DESIGN QUESTION (flagged for review, deliberately NOT resolved in
 *  this draft): Step 2 research. The live skill routes research through the
 *  `process-research` SKILL (H10 entry-point rule). A workflow agent() can
 *  dispatch AGENTS but cannot invoke a SKILL. This draft therefore treats
 *  research as a PRECONDITION gate (it halts and hands back rather than
 *  dispatching researchers directly, which would violate H10) — see researchGate().
 *  Resolving this properly is part of the (separately deferred) process-research
 *  conversion, not this pilot.
